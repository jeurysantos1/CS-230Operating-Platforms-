CS-230-X6074 Operating Platforms 


<h1>The Gaming Room, a game development company.</h1>

<br>

Software Requirements: Design software for their game "Draw It or Lose It" to expand onto different operating systems, integrate it into a distributed environment, ensure user security, and enable communication between various platforms.
<br>

The documentation effectively explained the selection of AWS for scalability, security, and global reach. Clear comparisons were made between cloud and traditional systems, and the benefits of serverless architecture were highlighted.
<br>

Developing the design document helped structure the software's architecture, functionalities, and integration points. It provided a roadmap for coding, ensuring alignment with project goals and client requirements.

<br>

 I would enhance the section detailing user needs and how they were incorporated. Providing more concrete examples and user scenarios would give a clearer picture of how the design catered to user expectations.
 <br>

User-Centered Approach: User needs were gathered through client discussions and requirements analysis. Implementing these needs is vital as it determines the software's usability, functionality, and overall success in the market.
<br>
Approach to Software Design: The design involved choosing AWS for scalability and integrating serverless architecture. In the future, I'd focus more on illustrating data flow and interactions between components, possibly using diagrams or flowcharts for clearer visualization.
<br>
Strategies for Future Design: I'd adopt an agile approach, ensuring continuous client feedback throughout the design process. Utilizing prototyping tools could help visualize and iterate on the design before committing to development. Additionally, considering user feedback at each stage would enhance the user experience and software quality.
